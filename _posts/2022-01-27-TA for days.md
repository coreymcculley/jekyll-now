I've been working as a TA for the 2U Data Science bootcamps. Up until recently, that had been as a substitute, but a few weeks ago I secured a primary TA role with UC Berkeley. Since then, I have also upped the number of sub spots I fill, but maybe I went a little overboard? For the next week or so I will be doing 2 classes a day (5 hours) 5 days a week, and potentially manning the help desk online for an addition 10 hours. All this after normal working hours. Good thing I don't have much of a social life IRL anyways.
